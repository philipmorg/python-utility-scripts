The results are stunning.

Systems built this way, with fewer compute and human resources will increase margins, accelerate growth, and strengthen defensive moats.

Costa Rica’s commitment to innovation is reflected in the development of technology parks utilized by top companies including IBM, Microsoft, VMWare, and many others.

Because of Costa Rica’s geographical proximity to the United States and overlapping time zones (CST), real-time communication is possible, with little to no latency.  Same travel and same-day work are possible with regular flights from San Jose CR to the U.S.

Costa Rica’s workforce is highly educated and fluent in both Spanish and English.  Costa Ricans have a strong work ethic.  The 22 Universities and colleges reflect the value that Costa Rican’s place on higher education.  

Intellectual property laws are strong in Costa Rica.  Adherence to IP laws, the enforcement of trademarks, patents and copyrights means that your intellectual property is safe.  

The cost of software development is significantly less expensive in Costa Rica than in the United States.

We stand up lean full-stack teams, drawing from hundreds of business analysts, UX designers, project managers, developers, QA and support engineers, and DevOps—people with master's degrees, 10+ years of experience, Agile certification—and closely tailor each team in management structure, composition, and methodology to the client's specific needs.

We recruit the best and work hard to retain them through professional and personal development and the excitement of working on new products. Our investment in people pays off: our annual attrition rate is less than 10%.

Together with our clients we build custom software solutions. Those solutions are diverse in their form and function as are the industries in which they are used. What is common to all is the business value they drive for the clients for whom they were constructed.

 • Excellent Communication
 Excellent communication skills are essential for an efficient collaboration. All our remote personnel are highly capable in written and verbal communication.

 Delivering quality is a top goal. We have high standards for quality and reach those through code reviews, unit testing, static analysis, manual and automatic testing.

***Codup focuses on 3 key areas of expertise***

Ecommmerce Solutions: Our deep industry knowledge positions us well to be a technology partner to e-commerce companies that want to focus purely on business and not worry about technology.

Product Development: Developing a successful product is more about shipping fast and engaging your users rather than building a massive feature set out of the gate. Not only can we help you make sense of technology and handle it for you, we can help you make smart compromises and trade-offs so you can keep going forward. 

Systems Integeration: Systems integrations have evolved in nature and given birth to the API economy. Codup can help leverage this new trend for massive cost and efficiency benefits while still enjoying perfect harmony of data among your various software suites.

***What our clients get by working with us***

Exceptional Communication: One of the biggest challenges for outsourcing to the South Asian region is communication. At a time when Collaboration and Clear Communication is becoming increasingly important for success of projects among distributed teams, most companies fare poorly at it. With Codup however, clear and upfront communication is king and it culminates into successful projects all the time.

Mature Processes: We have mature business processes in place that ensure successful understanding and delivery of projects. Each project goes through the following phases; requirements and analysis, estimations, scoping, design, development, testing, UAT, deployment, maintenance and support. 

Deep Understanding: Having had several medium and large projects under our belt, our team has a deep understanding of the domains we operate in. Coupled with our communication, we can deliver solutions that work for you and your users.",2012,100,,Houston,"12206 wrenthorpe dr, houston, texas, united states",77031-3036,+18155694297,"information technology and services"

***Codup focuses on 3 key areas of expertise***

Ecommmerce Solutions: Our deep industry knowledge positions us well to be a technology partner to e-commerce companies that want to focus purely on business and not worry about technology.

Product Development: Developing a successful product is more about shipping fast and engaging your users rather than building a massive feature set out of the gate. Not only can we help you make sense of technology and handle it for you, we can help you make smart compromises and trade-offs so you can keep going forward. 

Systems Integeration: Systems integrations have evolved in nature and given birth to the API economy. Codup can help leverage this new trend for massive cost and efficiency benefits while still enjoying perfect harmony of data among your various software suites.

***What our clients get by working with us***

Exceptional Communication: One of the biggest challenges for outsourcing to the South Asian region is communication. At a time when Collaboration and Clear Communication is becoming increasingly important for success of projects among distributed teams, most companies fare poorly at it. With Codup however, clear and upfront communication is king and it culminates into successful projects all the time.

Mature Processes: We have mature business processes in place that ensure successful understanding and delivery of projects. Each project goes through the following phases; requirements and analysis, estimations, scoping, design, development, testing, UAT, deployment, maintenance and support. 

Deep Understanding: Having had several medium and large projects under our belt, our team has a deep understanding of the domains we operate in.

What is our competitive edge?

Our clients can combine modules to integrate various aspects of risk management into a single software platform, achieving what we call ""Software Singularity"". 

Software Singularity represents having a single source of information to eliminate redundancy across different data sources, to maintain data integrity and consistency.

Founded in 2001 in Santa Cruz, CA and has built custom proprietary risk management software systems  through 2008. In 2010, A1 developed and released A1 Tracker with the 1st module.

We know that the software adoption process can be complex, with many moving parts and parties involved. While implementing custom web-based solutions over our 1st 10 years, cloud software matured. We observed a strong need for a software product with more flexibility as to integrate with and serve multiple departmental needs.

We therefore invested the knowledge and lessons gained over our 1st 10 years into A1 Tracker and the robust and dynamic architecture that drives it.

A1 Enterprise strengths extend far beyond the product offered. The investment into the  implementation process sets the stage for how well the software supports the business and how receptive users are to using the software. and ultimately our customers' ROI.

Well over 90% of the 2,000+ projects we've worked on have reached the marketplace. Our clients range from startups to some of the largest companies in the software world. We work primarily with companies that derive competitive advantage from their software offering.

Providing cost-effective analysis, architecture, UX design, rapid development, functional QA, QA automation, DevOps, maintenance, and support outsourcing solutions, Kanda succeeds—our clients succeed—because of our process and our people.

We employ a two-shore delivery mechanism: U.S.-based business analysis, architecture, and project management work in tandem with Kanda's technical organization in Europe and Latin America to optimize resource allocation and sustain a price-and-performance advantage over the full lifecycle of a customer's application.

We stand up lean full-stack teams, drawing from hundreds of business analysts, UX designers, project managers, developers, QA and support engineers, and DevOps—people with master's degrees, 10+ years of experience, Agile certification—and closely tailor each team in management structure, composition, and methodology to the client's specific needs.

We recruit the best and work hard to retain them through professional and personal development and the excitement of working on new products. Our investment in people pays off: our annual attrition rate is less than 10%.

Old Code. New Tricks.
Have an app that needs a little love? Maybe you want more functionality or better test coverage. Perhaps your app is sluggish and you don’t know why. Or you just might need to find a way to integrate your existing application into new systems that your business is using. 

Don’t Start Over — Remodel Your Code.

Sometimes this makes sense, but often it’s more cost effective to improve what you already have. Would you tear down your house if all you wanted to do was update your kitchen or add on a sunroom? No, you’d remodel what’s already there. Learn more about our remodeling and retrofitting services.

For more than a decade, we’ve helped over 100 companies to realize the full benefits of simulation.

VCollab automates the process of extracting, merging, and reporting simulation insights in 3D, high-fidelity, browser-viewable model-based simulation story boards, expanding access to critical simulation insights to everyone involved in design and manufacturing. 

Making actionable insights widely available leads to better and faster engineering decisions ― which leads to better products.

VCollab also saves valuable simulation analyst time by eliminating the need for manually-created, 2D simulation reports. Developing simulation reports for engineers who lack the access and skills to use native simulation tools not only wastes time, it substantially reduces the simulation information available to non-analysts.

With VCollab, report generation is automated, reducing the time to create & modify from days to minutes, while expanding access to high-fidelity 3D simulation insights to anyone in your organization or supply chain. 

And we make this possible with products that can be implemented in days, not weeks or months.

We offer NCQA/PCMH certification, accounting and financial services, analytical and quality reporting, malpractice support and human resources benefits. In addition, we leverage our strong relationships with insurers for the benefit of all of our practices, allowing them to focus on delivering the best care possible.

Innovation

We continually search for new, innovative approaches to the practice of medicine so you don’t have to. Allied’s use of centralized, physician-customized EMR, along with our point-of-care Quality Improvement Program, will allow your practice to become more efficient and provide a higher quality of patient care.

One example of the innovation we offer our physicians is through access to Phreesia, the best-in-class digital platform that has re-designed medical office workflow for the 21st century. Phreesia streamlines patient check-in, automates insurance verification, improves collections and gives both physician practices and patients access to customer service 24/7.

Collaboration
At Allied, we have created an environment where each physicians voice is heard and decisions are made by doctors, not by an outside committee, with consultation from business, management and IT professionals, and executed as the physician deems necessary.

We work to transform both your sales and customer experience, transcending the status quo of your industry or category. The result is richer customer engagement, deepened loyalty, reduced operational cost and accelerated revenue growth.

It has been said that you can define who you are by stating who you are not. We are not a business strategy firm. We are not an advertising or branding agency. We are not an information technology company. Yet we draw on all three of these disciplines to design Customer Resonance in what has been traditionally called Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

Most CRM implementations fail. We think that is a shame. The technology has been around for over a decade and the platform is mature. We’re here to change that statistic. CRM failures have much less to do with incapable technology, but rather flaws in the strategy (or the lack thereof), the ownership (or the lack thereof), the expectations or the implementation approach. We believe this is due to a technology based approach to CRM. CRM is not a technology, it is a belief, it is a mindset, and it is a pervasive, disruptive and positive transformation that can be enabled through technology.

We founded Frequency Foundry with the idea of combining a left-brain technical approach with a right-brain creative perspective to form a holistic view to designing business development and customer strategies that utilize CRM technology. As a result, we have a passion and an aptitude for business strategy, brand strategy, user experience design, consumer research and CRM technology development and implementation.

Blue Dot will achieve our goals through three interdependent functions:

Blue Dot Project Systems Research. In partnership with researchers, we use ""systems thinking"" to deeply understand how our natural capital systems work. Instead of throwing resources at environmental problems that may be merely symptomatic, we aim to identify the fundamental elements that need to change to reach true sustainability.

Blue Dot Capitals. Our investment platform is dedicated to raising funds that will flow directly to the areas of natural capital crucial for systemic change (including reforestation, carbon markets, local economic development, carbon capture, and decentralized and circular systems).

Blue Dot Project Diffusion of Innovations Services. With a nod to the 1962 theory about the process and rate by which new ideas and technology spread, we use everything we've learned to help companies, local communities, and NGOs accelerate the adoption rate of crucial technologies and initiatives.

The World's Most Legendary Racetrack®
Known as the home of the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks, Churchill Downs Racetrack conducts Thoroughbred horse racing in Louisville, Kentucky during three race meets in the Spring, September, and the Fall. The racetrack occupies 147 acres, featuring a one-mile dirt, oval racetrack and a seven furlong turf race course. Thoroughbred racing, the Kentucky Derby, and the Kentucky Oaks have run continuously at Churchill Downs Racetrack since 1875. In addition, Churchill Downs Racetrack has hosted the Breeders' Cup World Championship eight times.

Over the course of three centuries, the track has completed several massive renovation projects to modernize its venerable grandstand and clubhouse and to accommodate its more than 165,000 guests on Kentucky Derby Day. Modernization projects have included the construction of private luxury suites and integrated simulcast areas, the installation of permanent lights to operate night-time race programs, and building The Big Board – the world's largest 4k video screen. The Twin Spires that sit atop the grandstands remain the most recognizable architectural feature of Churchill Downs and serve as a symbol of the racetrack. The spires were designed by architect Joseph Dominic Baldez and were built in 1895 – they shine across the world's most legendary racetrack each night.",1875,120,,Louisville,"700 central ave, louisville, kentucky, united states, 40208",40208,5026364400,sports

There’s a lot of ways technology is enhancing lives—from ordering food, rideshare services, gaming, streaming, ebooks—almost anything can be done now from a smartphone. We’re looking to bring that ease and peace of mind to renting as well. 

For landlords that want to self-manage their properties, we’re empowering them by centralizing and streamlining the property management and tenant relationship process—condensing the need for multiple platform visits into one. Everything they need to do to manage their rentals—rent, maintenance, tenant screenings, communication, listings—they can do it from our dashboard. For tenants, we’re putting the power to prequalify and apply to rentals, pay rent, communicate, and submit maintenance requests into their hands—literally.

For Renters: Mobile Apps for tablets, iPhone, and Android.

VETTX offers a revolutionary CRM for dealerships to acquire pre-owned vehicles directly from private sellers in your local market. 
https://linktr.ee/Vettx.inc
https://linktr.ee/Vettx.inc


As you know, the private party market has lots of noise that can keep you from tapping into its full potential.

How Does VETTX Work?

So instead of wasting your time chasing down unreliable leads or negotiating with people who are
out of their minds, let us filter that stuff out and bring you only quality vehicles that match your specific parameters.

1. Based on your pre-set parameters, i.e your desired inventory, our software filters through the private party market and targets vehicles in your area that make business for your dealership. 

2. Then our in house data team will book out every vehicle onto the VETTX platform, using industry-standard appraising tools, and run Carfax and Autocheck to ensure there are no red flags and you are only seeing quality
vehicles that are guaranteed to sell.

3. Once you find a car that interests you, you can set an appointment and send email confirmations to yourself and the seller in one click. Next thing you know the vehicle is sent straight to your dealership. All you really need to do on your end is do a final walkaround and finalize the deal. 

Our service is not a one-size-fits-all solution. We tailor the software parameters to match the specific needs of your dealership. If you’re ready to see for yourself how we can transform your used car acquisition process, visit our website to schedule a free demo today!",,22,,,,,,automotive

Many of our tools, appliances, home computers and cars are built to fail, encouraging us to get back out there and buy, buy again. But there’s also a resurgence in a different, older school of thought that runs counter to that. The belief that things should be built to last. People now expect more from their coolers, jeans, workboots and blenders. We think you should expect the same from your grease interceptor.

When we started with Schier in 2003, half of our products were made from steel. Guaranteed to fail. Some plumbers would half-joke “hey man, that’s job security.” Not to us. In 2006 when we launched the Great Basin™, we made a bet that our customers wanted something better. We believed that grease interceptors should not only be ridiculously efficient but they should also last a long time.

All nonprofits share a common dream: to make the world a better place. They also share a common reality: they rely on donors and funding to keep working toward their goals.

That’s where Eleo comes in. The people behind Eleo believe every nonprofit—no matter its size—should have access to affordable, comprehensive donor management software to support its crucial fundraising and donor cultivation tasks. So that’s exactly what we’ve developed.

Eleo is a product of Community Software Solutions, Inc. (CSS), a company whose specialized software has supported the social programs of numerous nonprofits and governmental organizations since 1991. Eleo grew out of CSS founder and CEO Mark Grossman’s commitment to supporting the vital role nonprofits play in our society. Mark realized the company’s data management and tracking technologies could be applied to provide nonprofits large and small with useful, niche-specific, user-friendly tools to help them make the most of their donor cultivation and fundraising efforts. 

Support for philanthropic work is at the heart of Eleo’s mission: our name takes its inspiration from the Greek goddess Eleos, the personification of charity and compassion (the English word eleemosynary, meaning “pertaining to charity,” stems from similar Greek roots). Our staff members are deeply engaged in charity work—both as active volunteers and as donors and supporters—and we believe in the power of nonprofits to bring about positive change. 

Your organization has important work to accomplish. We want to help you make a bigger difference in the world by giving you access to software specifically designed to increase your donor cultivation and fundraising results, so you can spend your time and energy where it matters most.",,4,,,,,,"software development"

C-level business executives require accurate, real-time, decision-ready data provided in an easily consumable manner to drive strategy, set goals, automate processes and achieve business outcomes. IT leaders need to quickly and easily enable these requirements while tackling the reality of multiple, single-purpose, siloed systems and data that are often redundant and cannot deliver the necessary insights in useful explainable formats. 

edgeTI solves real-world problems by extracting and aggregating operational and management data from disconnected systems to orchestrate specific tasks across various business and IT systems. Progress, status, and results are presented in the context of each user’s role, allowing the same data to be used for different perspectives and ensuring everyone is working in sync. Everyday scheduled and ad-hoc work becomes more observable, scalable, faster, efficient, and accurate.

The edgeCore™ Platform installs on-premise or in-your-cloud and is based on a Kubernetes native, microservice modern architecture with robust RESTful APIs — making it highly extensible, portable, and scalable. It features dozens of out-of-the-box, low-code integrations for industry-leading software and SaaS services, as well as multiple data extract and transform methods via a powerful SDK. edgeCore is trusted by financial, healthcare, telecom, government, and managed service providers — powering real-time access to data in a transparent, measurable, executable, and explainable way.

See it happen.

Born in the heartland of northern Illinois, the seeds of MPOWR® were planted in 2002 by Peter Provenzano as a result of being placed on the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing companies in the country with his integrated supply management business, SupplyCore.

A group of executives who had all made the list were meeting quarterly to exchange information and learn from each other. Peter needed a way to report organizational results and so, in true Midwestern, get-it-done style, he asked his software team to come up with an internal tool that would track progress against strategic objectives. Here began the roots of the software known today as Envision. ""This software allows us to actually execute our strategy. My managers and leaders use the tool to communicate plans and initiatives tracking progress towards each goal. Because of Envision we have been able to lead our company through a period of incredible growth, causing us to return to the Inc. list of high growth businesses a total of 8 times!""​

In the meantime, a local shelter began developing software to help end the cycle of homelessness by connecting different social service organizations with a common platform of information believing that if knowledge could be shared across agencies, it would improve outcomes. The goal was to assist both the individuals and the community at large through collective impact and collaboration.

Peter felt strongly about helping to improve his hometown and in 2013 SupplyCore purchased this software, renaming it Engage. Using SupplyCore’s resources, Engage is used by not-for-profits in communities across the country, nurturing self-sufficient individuals and their families. Together, with Envision for strategy execution, the two platforms empower the people, organizations, and businesses who use them.",2002,11,,,,,8159971660,"software development"

Verifi1 expertly manages the collection of documents for the verification process, making it easy for employees to submit via scan/upload, fax and mail. We use a fully automated system backed with the most advanced OCR technology to process scanned data and verify eligibility as determined by an employer’s specific eligibility rules.

Verifi1 promotes the integration and management of:

     - Legacy Relationship Reviews - verifying eligible relationships across an entire enrolled population
     - Ongoing Relationship Reviews - validating relationships of newly added dependents
     - Life Event Reviews - verifying the validity of the event

This provides the most efficient and cost effective means to curb ineligible dependent healthcare expense, and to maintain accurate census data for benefit eligible enrollees.",,5,,,,,,insurance

The ability to accomplish more with fewer steps was high on everyone's list of must-haves. This resulted in the time-saving feature we call ""Account Central""​. Our customers love it, and here's why. Absolutely all information you might need access to for a customer account, all billing and accounting information, work orders, etc. is available from one screen. One. Gone are the days of drilling down through countless screens to send a customer an adjusted bill!

One issue that needed to be addressed was the ability to access the data base from other locations and not just from the office computer. Another point that needed to be addressed was that constant interruptions for software updates cost time and money. These two issues were killed with one great idea. We made Muni-Link a cloud-based solution. Now you can access your accounts and information from wherever you are from any device. Plus, no one needs to come into your office to perform updates. They're done during non-business hours so your day to day operations are never interrupted. And that means you never pay for software updates. Ever. Another added benefit of cloud-based software is that back-up and recovery systems are built-in and done automatically. Your data is now more secure than ever before.
Muni-Link WebPresence is another way that we have improved the lives of billing office worker. WebPresence expands your organization’s website to become a true portal, with the capability to access a host of educational resources and personalized information for community stakeholders.

OUR INVERTED ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

The ▼ over the ""i""​ in our logo represents two important characteristics: 

1) The lower-case i de-emphasizes the individual; we win as a team, and we lose as a team. It takes everyone, doing their best to succeed.

2) The upside down triangle, ▼ represents our inverted organization structure. We put our clients and consultants/contractors before ourselves, with management at the bottom of the priority list. Others before ourselves!

PSI® specializes in engineering and manufacturing sustainable and innovative solutions for a variety of applications that improve supply chains, reduce costs, and protect products.

Bottled water companies and manufacturers are challenged with the high costs of damaged products, safety threats due to inferior wood or metal products, contamination risks, and overall production line inefficiencies.

Why is this happening? 

1.	Wooden pallets splinter and chip and are hotbeds for cross-contamination and bug infestations and create havoc, especially when used in an automated plant.
2.	Metal is very heavy, rusts bends and gets punctured, creating sharp points that often creates injuries to your workforce.
3.	Cardboard and corrugated boxes get wet and fall apart. And, if it is dropped there is little to no product protection. Lastly, it typically ends up in a landfill, which is a lose-lose for everyone.

Reusable packaging is the solution to all of these challenges. 

1.	Factory line efficiencies are significantly improved due to the dimensional consistency and longevity of returnable packaging solutions
2.	It has a lifespan of up to 20 years, making the total cost of ownership pennies on the dollar 
3.	It is sustainable and recyclable, which makes it is not only good for the environment but helps you meet your corporate sustainability goals.
4.	These products resist bending, chipping, splintering and make the workplace safer.
5.	It is easily customizable, making packaging completely tailored to the company’s logistics needs.

PSI® is committed to helping our customers find solutions that drive efficiencies and profitability by meeting their material handling needs and sustainability requirements.

We help Real Estate investors diversify their portfolio with high ROI Digital Real Estate.

➤ HOW WE DO IT: 

We build eCommerce businesses for our clients using our simple arbitrage formula. This opportunity allows Real Estate investors to own a Real Digital Asset that will pay you every single month. If you are interested in diversifying your portfolio of cash flowing assets through ownership of a fully automated drop shipping business, then I highly suggest you book a 15 minute call with our team to learn more. The end result is you owning a completely passive cash flowing digital asset. It is very simple on your end and looks like this. You pay the startup fee of your choosing which dictates your profit split in the deal, then we develop your eCommerce business by simply plugging you into our already proven system, and let our team handle the rest. You now own an appreciating, sellable asset, that spits off cash flow month over month. I highly encourage you to at least book a discovery call and take the time to learn more about how this works, underwrite the deal, and look at what cash-on-cash returns we are currently getting for our investors.

➤ WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: 

We have been in the eCommerce space for over 5 years and have figured out the formula for building micro dropshipping stores that simply arbitrage products on different platforms.

We help Real Estate investors diversify their portfolio with high ROI Digital Real Estate.

➤ HOW WE DO IT: 

We build eCommerce businesses for our clients using our simple arbitrage formula. This opportunity allows Real Estate investors to own a Real Digital Asset that will pay you every single month. If you are interested in diversifying your portfolio of cash flowing assets through ownership of a fully automated drop shipping business, then I highly suggest you book a 15 minute call with our team to learn more. The end result is you owning a completely passive cash flowing digital asset. It is very simple on your end and looks like this. You pay the startup fee of your choosing which dictates your profit split in the deal, then we develop your eCommerce business by simply plugging you into our already proven system, and let our team handle the rest. You now own an appreciating, sellable asset, that spits off cash flow month over month. I highly encourage you to at least book a discovery call and take the time to learn more about how this works, underwrite the deal, and look at what cash-on-cash returns we are currently getting for our investors.

➤ WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: 

We have been in the eCommerce space for over 5 years and have figured out the formula for building micro dropshipping stores that simply arbitrage products on different platforms.

We help Real Estate investors diversify their portfolio with high ROI Digital Real Estate.

➤ HOW WE DO IT: 

We build eCommerce businesses for our clients using our simple arbitrage formula. This opportunity allows Real Estate investors to own a Real Digital Asset that will pay you every single month. If you are interested in diversifying your portfolio of cash flowing assets through ownership of a fully automated drop shipping business, then I highly suggest you book a 15 minute call with our team to learn more. The end result is you owning a completely passive cash flowing digital asset. It is very simple on your end and looks like this. You pay the startup fee of your choosing which dictates your profit split in the deal, then we develop your eCommerce business by simply plugging you into our already proven system, and let our team handle the rest. You now own an appreciating, sellable asset, that spits off cash flow month over month. I highly encourage you to at least book a discovery call and take the time to learn more about how this works, underwrite the deal, and look at what cash-on-cash returns we are currently getting for our investors.

➤ WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: 

We have been in the eCommerce space for over 5 years and have figured out the formula for building micro dropshipping stores that simply arbitrage products on different platforms.

Those programs have been expanded through several administrations and some were made permanent in the Obama administration. In fact, 43 States have their own version of some of these programs. In the last 12 months alone, we have helped over 140 businesses get back over $6,000,000.00 from these Congressionally mandated programs. If a company is trying to grow their business, expand it, manufacture something, improve an existing product or are being creative in making themselves more competitive, they likely qualify.  

▣ HOW COMPANIES CAN QUALIFY:

If a company is trying to grow their business, expand it, manufacture something, improve an existing product or are being creative in making themselves more competitive, they likely qualify. However, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, only 5% of small businesses in this country take advantage of these benefits simply because they don't even know they exist. 

▣ EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRIES WHO MAY QUALIFY:

◉ Manufacturing
◉ Construction
◉ Engineering
◉ Textiles
◉ Agriculture
◉ Doctors -Dentists - Chiropractors
◉ Oil & Gas
◉ Financial Services
◉ Software
◉ Telecommunications
◉ Website Development
◉ Medical Devices
◉ Chemical & Plastics
◉ Paper & Forest Products

Advancements in information technology most visible through companies like Amazon and WeWork have been transforming real estate use for over twenty years. The rise of COVID-19 has accelerated these changes and introduced several new challenges for real estate owners, developers and operators. While some COVID-19 challenges are likely to dissipate over time (e.g., physical distancing), others will leave a legacy and transform real estate use forever.

SpaceBot’s vision is to improve safety and human experiences in the built environment by tapping into various technologies and sources of socio-spatial data. To this end, SpaceBot’s team of engineers and data scientists have developed a proprietary platform to analyze people, vehicles and other contextual objects in real-time; predict, manage and communicate resource demand; and more generally help real estate owners, developers, and operators understand and ultimately optimize the safety and financial performance of their spatial assets and the experiences they enable.",,3,,,,,,"real estate"

After watching their mother abandon yet another bag, her sons suggested she invent one herself.  But as a woman in her mid-60s, she wondered how she would ever get from Point A to Point B.  So eventually devoted sons Jan and Derek ditched their respective day jobs in advertising and product design research (and nightly gigs as DJ’s) to help make Helen's dream a reality.

Lo & Sons bags are built to travel light without compromising functionality and style.  Every single high-quality feature was designed to meet the needs of frequent travelers, movers and shakers.

The parent company, Spectrum Net Designs, Inc., started small by providing custom website design and hosting from the home basement of our president, Kurt Kaptein.

Our Blue Goose Platform is a stand-alone Accounting and Policy Management platform designed specifically for MGAs, Program Administrators, Wholesalers, and Small Carriers to better manage workflow, policy administration, document management, and accounting.   
 
THE BLUE GOOSE PLATFORM 
Main functions: 
 
▪️Policy Administration and Underwriting Workflow- Rules-based workflow engineering that automates and tracks submission, clearance, quoting, binding and policy issuance.  And, whether it’s your solution or ours, we can integrate with any system using our out-of-the-box API.

▪️AR, AP, and GL System- Stand-alone system accommodates agency bill, carrier billing to insured, or when you bill insured. Handles tax reporting and generates easy-to-read agent, account, and broker statements. 

▪️Document Management- Intelligent document management integrated into our policy management systems to manage all of your data, including scans, emails, Word and Excel documents, faxes, photography, policies, and claims –all in one location. 
 
Many clients we meet have older legacy or less robust systems built for smaller retail agencies.  Others have the newer no/low code systems, which don’t include general ledger and accounting support.
 
These systems often lack processing or integration capabilities and can’t fully accommodate the needs of MGAs, Program Administrators, or Wholesalers without expensive and difficult customization.  
 
At Blue Goose, our breakthrough technology is designed specifically for today's demanding workloads without extensive programming changes. We offer out-of-the-box usability that can be quickly configured to meet any of your needs and help you streamline all of your accounting, policy, and document management processes.

Well over 90% of the 2,000+ projects we've worked on have reached the marketplace. Our clients range from startups to some of the largest companies in the software world. We work primarily with companies that derive competitive advantage from their software offering.

Providing cost-effective analysis, architecture, UX design, rapid development, functional QA, QA automation, DevOps, maintenance, and support outsourcing solutions, Kanda succeeds—our clients succeed—because of our process and our people.

We employ a two-shore delivery mechanism: U.S.-based business analysis, architecture, and project management work in tandem with Kanda's technical organization in Europe and Latin America to optimize resource allocation and sustain a price-and-performance advantage over the full lifecycle of a customer's application.

We stand up lean full-stack teams, drawing from hundreds of business analysts, UX designers, project managers, developers, QA and support engineers, and DevOps—people with master's degrees, 10+ years of experience, Agile certification—and closely tailor each team in management structure, composition, and methodology to the client's specific needs.

We recruit the best and work hard to retain them through professional and personal development and the excitement of working on new products. Our investment in people pays off: our annual attrition rate is less than 10%.

Business as Mission
Business has both intrinsic and instrumental value in God’s purposes for the world. But because it can also be a tool for oppression, greed, and misuse of natural resources, its original good purposes are often overshadowed. These need to be uncovered and reclaimed.

Even if it never advanced a church program, business would still be used of God to:

provide means for families to support themselves
provide humanity with needed goods and services
provide meaningful work through which people emulate God’s creativity and productivity
help people discover their vocational talents
curb evil by occupying people’s time with activities that serve the greater good

Beyond these intrinsic uses for business, it plays vastly important instrumental roles as well. Have you ever stopped to realize that business is the source of the wealth which funds all the good done by non-profits, governments, and schools?",,7,,,,,,"non-profit organizations"

Severne is an authentic Australian windsurfing brand. Our products are all designed and comprehensively tested and retested in Western Australia by some of the dedicated and talented windsurfers on the planet.

We created Severne for two reasons; firstly, we love windsurfing and secondly, we want to build gear that helps you enjoy windsurfing as much as we do. We are obsessed with creating the best windsurfing gear.

Like all good companies, the core strength of Severne lies in the people behind the brand; the people with the imagination, drive and technical expertise to bring our visions to life. We are also privileged to work with some of the most talented athletes in the history of windsurfing. People like Philip Köster, Matteo Iachino, Jaeger Stone, Daida and Iballa Moreno, Amado Vrieswijk, Bjorn Dunkerbeck, Scott McKercher and Boujmaa Giulloul. These guys literally push the boundaries of possibility every time they step out onto the water. We would like to thank all of our employees, riders and customers who displayed individuality and the revolution!

Our mission statement; 
Lighter, more responsive gear developed by windsurfers, means thinking less about your equipment and more about your windsurfing performance.

For every windsurfer;
Severne designs and develops gear for every level, location and every style. Always designing from a windsurfers perspective. We always test all of our products ourselves in the best conditions. The evolution of Severne's products doesn't stop, and development is continous.

Every business should expect transparency and effectiveness from their healthcare spend.  For many companies, healthcare is the second major cost after salaries, and yet there is no enterprise tool for mid-market self-insured employers to manage this spend. 

zakipoint Health has one goal: to enable every company, regardless of size, to understand and lower their health care costs — easily and affordably.  This is a market worth $2.5 - $ 3 bn, yet is poorly served, and not served at all for businesses with less than 3,000 employees.
 
Our practical approach is reflected in our core slogan: ""see Clearly; take Action; save Money""​. 

We deliver actionable cost containment recommendations and a relevant marketplace for risk owning entities — self-insured employers; health plans; and ACOs — to understand and save on healthcare spend.  Our solution z5, is a SaaS-based tool that integrates all healthcare data, enabling a customer to analyze claims; population risks (current and future) and programs, plus provider and benefit plan performance in one place, and then take action through our targeted marketplace. 

Our customers love what we do for them;

""Our business has been buffeted by the ever increasing medical costs for years, just like most other companies in America...
...More recently we started working with zakipoint Health to improve our management of healthcare costs. Their ability to mine, drill down into our medical insurance data and provide us with actionable insights that to date has not been available from anyone else looks to be another key strategy in helping us to mitigate the ever rising costs of providing health coverage to our employees. We look forward to turning their identified 7% savings into real savings""​

​
Many, if not most, of our students struggle with multiple challenges, and our program is designed to address the whole child through:
• Engaged and joyful classroom experiences with low student-to-teacher ratios (generally 8:1)
• Differentiated and supported content delivery tailored for individual student learning styles and needs, including an evolving assistive technology (or ed tech) program
• Incorporating executive functioning skills, social skills, and pragmatics curriculum at all grade levels
• Integrated experiential learning both on and off campus
• Comprehensive electives and extracurricular and social activities
• Transition programs, including mainstreaming to public/private schools, life skills, college preparation, and job skills training for high school students

Our skilled faculty and staff are dedicated to understanding each student’s learning and interpersonal styles in order to seamlessly integrate social skills into the classroom and all aspects of student life. We teach students to better understand themselves and learn how to better self-advocate.

While the school’s core focus is our academic program, our philosophy is to provide a whole school experience and community for each student at every grade level. We want each of our students to have the opportunity to participate in any age-appropriate, school-related activity that they might not otherwise be able to access at a traditional school.",,42,,,,,,"primary and secondary education"

Hoplark was born during to a trip to a local brewpub in 2016 that, we admit, was probably a bad idea. Dean took his best friend, Andrew to try a great new beer he had found. The problem was that Dean had 5 days left on his first round with the Whole30 diet. After years of trying, Dean had finally found a diet that worked. He was 50 pounds overweight and desperate for a solution, so he did not order a beer that day. The hoppy aroma of Andrew’s double IPA made him realize how much Dean missed that sophisticated flavor of a great beer that really didn’t exist without the alcohol and calories. It was tough, but he stuck to his commitment.

We immediately started talking about how to add delicious hop flavors to something low calorie and healthy like tea. It took about 18 months and hundreds of admittedly terrible HopTea batches before we made a product that we were proud of. It was important to us to brew it with actual organic tea leaves and use real hops, not extracts. HopTea also had to not rely on sugar to cover up off flavors, it had to let the hops shine. We launched in May of 2018 at a farmer’s market in Denver, Colorado. To our first-time customers, HopTea is completely unexpected, but yet surprisingly familiar, with connections to craft beer, tea and sparkling beverages. Our customers showed us that HopTea is much more than a beer replacement, it is an experience in its own right.

Due to the many fans that keep on buying our product at grocery stores, restaurants and farmers markets we decided to build our own Hoplark brewery and taproom in Boulder, Colorado. We will open our doors to the public in early 2019. We are committed to creating innovative, healthy beverages made the right way and hope you will join us in this journey.

MathDB (Desktop, Cloud and Embedded for IoT versions) technology empowers Big Data and Machine learning processes by abstracting database interface over time series data, implementing fast minimal-loss streaming queries by exploiting structural features of the stored data.  MathDB time series data is stored through a mathematical decomposition based on Fourier and Wavelet modes in a way that is optimized for streaming queries.  As a feature unique to MathDB, such queries can be made faster by the selective recombination of the stored decomposition.  By only accessing parts of the stored data at a time, MathDB reconstructs the data in a fraction of the IO access time with minimal loss of fidelity. This abstracted database interface has shown promise in data science applications by enhancing many existing tools and workflows, as well as opening the door to new potential innovations. The most direct benefit is to the runtime of streaming IO-bound algorithms (such as training models or performing statistics on large data sets that cannot be stored in memory).  Read times have shown to be reduced by factors of 50 and 100 with little or no loss in model predictive capability in real data sets, speeding up ANN training or statistical model fitting by orders of magnitude.",2012,10,,"Las Vegas","4616 west sahara avenue, las vegas, nv, united states",89102,+18667468352,"information technology and services"

Wireless Innovations has been a Premier Partner of Cradlepoint for the past three years and we are the only Exclusive Partner to have the ability to bill Cradlepoint hardware devices and software services on a Sprint invoice. Making this a clear advantage over other carriers. 
Our ability to customize the experience of Sprint’s customers with their devices have added to many wins to Sprint teams nationwide. Through our partnerships with leading MDM solutions such as Samsung Knox, Jamf, and Hexnode, Wireless Innovations helps deliver not only a customized user experience, but can also provide the daily management and support of this MDM solution.  This is crucial to most accounts in the SMB space and even the Enterprise environment where the IT staff is nonexistent or does not have the bandwidth to support.   Typically, this is not offered by other carriers adding another clear differentiator for T-Mobile 
WI’s enhancements and support services for T-M0bile's offerings provide a single point of contact project manager, combined with complete back office support for both the customer and T-Mobile's representative. This additional value of support services that WI offers including full life cycle support not only ensures a successful deployment but provides for a happy customer that is open to additional T-Mobile's solutions going forward.
