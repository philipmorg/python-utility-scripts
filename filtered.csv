• 	Giving their employees access to their desktops, applications, email, and data from any device, anywhere, at any time.
• 	Getting the best friendly technical expertise and support, quickly.
• 	Saving up to 50% on hardware, software, and IT services.
• 	Preventing ransomware, malware, spam, and other forms of cyber attacks.	

We were founded in 1987 by current CEO Gregory Hanna straight out of college. In the late ‘90’s, Greg noticed an emerging technology called the Cloud. While most businesses were still trying to wrap their minds around using a simple search engine or email service, Greg invested in utilizing this innovative technology to help businesses. In 

1999, TOSS C3 had their first data center and since then we’ve become the premier privately-held cloud provider in the New England area. 

While the technology has changed, what hasn’t is our commitment to developing the technological and personal skills of our team members. We think of each other more as a family than just coworkers. Cultivating an environment in which each person’s incredible talents can shine is a key focus, because in the IT consultancy industry you are only as strong as your team. 

TOSS C3 is the sole provider of groundbreaking products such as IT as a Utility®, vBCDR®, and MLRS®.

Do you know if your team going to deliver the results? 

Or, 

Are they going to put your reputation at stake?

Are you: 
⁉️ Frustrated with moving delivery dates?

⁉️ Concerned that your team doesn't seem to ask you right questions?

⁉️ Worried that you can't rely on your team to deliver specific results?


Let’s be honest, a lot of software projects continue to be shelved (read 'fail') because of numerous reasons.

Both you and your development team TOGETHER make a project successful. It’s the collaboration. It’s the teamwork. And most importantly, a step by step process or a system for you & your team to attain PREDICTABLE OUTCOMES during the product development journey. 


There are things you and your team could do to minimize risks and avoid failure. I help identify possible bottlenecks such as:

✅ Communication: It's important to build a cadence for communication between and among stakeholders.

✅ Team or Leadership Issues: Think of alignment issues in a vehicle. Is your team aligned with your product goals?

✅ Delays in Delivery: Is the project really delayed or expectation is not being managed between 'what-your-team-could-humanely-deliver' vs 'a rush to deliver the project yesterday'? 


I can help deliver the results you have envisioned for your software projects. Some of the feedback from Clients: 

“Great communication and delivered results that met and/or exceeded the project requirements.”

""Great experience, communication, execution. Very helpful. Subodh explained my options and was an advocate to what is best for me. Did not take advantage of me as a customer without much knowledge.""


Let’s strike a conversation and I will help remove the bottlenecks.

5M supports all paratransit functions, including client eligibility management, registration and administration, reservations, scheduling, continuous re-optimization and dispatching, supervisory monitoring, comprehensive performance and analytical reporting, run structure and service mix optimization in test environments, electronic billing and invoicing, and auditing and compliance analyses.

5M’s engine features (1) a trip-matching and demand balancing algorithm that increases the number of shared-trips and results in higher productivities; (2) a lightning fast (under a minute!) algorithm that batch schedules highly productive runs and trip clusters for dispatching; and (3) a combination of re-optimization and dispatching functions that take real time traffic into consideration.

5M’s driver tablets provide step-by-step directions, reminders, Google-based navigation assistance to drivers and proximity alerts and allow for two IVR/SMS arrival notifications to riders and a family member, friend or caregiver.  With complete manifests saved on the tablets, there is little chance of service interruption if communications go down.  And with 5M’s auto geo-correct function, trip reconciliation becomes a thing of the past.

5M also provides 24/7 web-based and IVR-based direct booking, as policies permit.  Its Mobile Rider Assistant enables web-based booking and ETA checks from any mobile device or computer with access to the internet. 5M’s customer portal enables feedback and survey opportunities, and allows customers to check the service quality statistics of their trips.",,7.0,,,,,,software development

Meet Nic Chaillan, serial Entrepreneur and the first Chief Software Officer in the Department of Defense for the United States Air Force and Space Force.
 
He brought DevSecOps to the largest behemoth that is DoD on jets, bombers, space systems and even nukes! He’s sharing his insights and time, in these courses, with recurring content and fresh, yearly updated video segment to help you implement the right Digital Transformation for your organization.

Struggling to get momentum and educate your leadership and showing them the light? Nic was able to educate 4 star generals and government appointees on what Kubernetes and containers are. 
Sure, they thought he was trying to ship containers to Afghanistan at first but now, leaders in DoD speak Digital transformation and understand the importance of innovation, lean and velocity of work.

Rwazi is a market intelligence platform that provides multinational consumer goods companies with actionable data from developing markets on who is buying what, for how much, from where, when, and why, to help them drive revenue and expand.

HOW WE DO IT:
We combine technology and a network of 20,000+ qualified data collectors (called ""mappers"") spread across urban and rural areas in 40+ countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, to collect data from their localities - allowing us to collect data from thousands of locations, and consumers, on a daily basis.

WHY?
There is no means of collecting and analyzing on-ground data from developing countries, particularly African countries. 
- On one hand, organizations need near real-time, on-ground data to make effective decisions on activities such as expansion, investments, distribution, new product/service offerings, and reaching target beneficiaries.
- On the other hand, millions of young people in Africa need income-generating activities. They are educated, use smartphones, have daily access to the internet, and are the target consumers or beneficiaries. 

OUR UNIQUE ADVANTAGE:
We are the first and only company in the world with a large and growing network of mappers spread across urban and rural areas all over sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Asia.

OUR CUSTOMERS:
For-profit organizations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies.

We develop solutions for organizations that help them fix broken business processes because of rapid growth or pivoting to changes in the marketplace. 

We understand how complicated choosing a software solution can be. Common scenarios include clients needing to buy software and can't decide, they bought the software, and are having installation issues or they are unable to integrate with the other systems in their organization, we understand the challenges.  We provide solutions that help our clients achieve success through higher profits, more customer satisfaction without over complicating things. We tailor the solution to their specific business case and not the other way around.  Whether you’re creating a custom solution or you’re trying to integrate a solution, our goal is simple…always striving for your satisfaction, your customer's satisfaction and making sure that we protect your business interest in the process.  

Agile project management is at the core of our process. Our methodologies ensure successful delivery on time and on budget.  We start by identifying where the bottle necks in your process are.  Most of the time this is because clients don't have software to support this business process.  Other times, the bottle neck is a dedicated employee using out of process solutions to ""make it work"".  This scenario leads to what we call process silos.  Often difficult to spot, these silos are exposed in times of rapid growth.  Our experts can help identify these silos, and develop the integration to connect them to your software solution.  It can also be challenging to get users to adopt new process as they become accustomed to how things are done.

Users design their forms, and then use the forms on their iOS, Android, or Windows device to capture information. The mobile app works both offline and online. 

Users can select from a library of more than 140 pre-designed form apps, or produce their own custom form and data-driven apps using the drag-and-drop form designer. No coding experience is required. Forms can be designed to align precisely with existing forms created in Word or Excel.

Your apps will capture text, numbers, dates, photos, video, audio, annotations, barcodes, near-field communication (NFC), signature, GPS locations, mapping, and more. 

Users can automatically dispatch forms to other remote users and send notifications back to the office via email, with the ability to send emails instantly, after a delay, or according to user-specified conditions. Email layouts can be customized, and form fields can be used for email body, attachments, and file names. Multiple file types can be attached, including PDF, TXT, CSV, DOCX, and XLSX.

Save time by choosing from thousands of connectors to your data systems and pre-populate data to your forms. Save time by eliminating travel back to the office. Save 100% of the time it takes to re-enter, re-assemble, file, and distribute forms to those who need them.

Craftlogic is also experienced in IT Infrastructure, Project Management, Software Development Management, Database Engineering, and Quality Assurance. We have decades of Software Development and IT Infrastructure experience.

Why We Do It: Craftlogic was founded and is operated by senior information technology professionals who not only share a deep passion for great software and technology but also for the value companies can derive from it in achieving their business objectives and differentiating their companies in the market place.

We were frustrated with the solutions offered in the marketplace and it was clear they were developed by marketing and sales people and not technologists. Capitalizing on our years of experience building successful development and technology teams, we developed a unique business model and processes that use experienced technologists to scout for the best technical talent and then to validate that talent to build teams that are more creative, productive and efficient. Based on our years of experience, we believe the most important element for success to any technical initiative is getting the best talent on the team.

Craftlogic got its start as a software development company founded on the simple principal that software is not created on an assembly line. Software is created by Craftsmen. Like the Craftsmen of old, it takes a combination of Skill, Talent and Passion to be the best. We apply this principal to everything we do.

Who We Are: We are owned and operated by technology experts. Craftlogic is itself a reflection of our philosophy. Software, logic, we believe, is crafted by skilled individuals; craftsmen.",2003.0,3.0,,,,,+18888878405,it services and it consulting

Sangrove is a new B2B2C platform for consumer goods industries, specializing in volume made-to-order pre-sell, leading to sustainable consumption and substantial environmental impact.
As a new proprietary platform, we connect brands with sustainability-conscious and fashion-forward buyers/consumers, and collectively green-light manufacturing of new products while eliminating excess design concepts.

We specifically address the main pains of design-driven industries, that produce consumer goods with the short life span, eliminating speculative overproduction, excess inventory, and dead stock for brands and retailers alike, leading to cost savings and higher profits across platform participants. The Brand (or Retailer) will benefit with optimized stock planning, increasing profit margins while coming up with a great marketing story. 

Our process and technology involve sustainability-conscious and fashion-forward buyers/consumers in the selection process by means of a limited-time mass digital pre-sell. 

Sangrove’s blockchain-based smart contract technology aggregates small orders into bulk in real-time, while bringing all participants into a legally binding Supplier & Collective Buyers' Agreement.

Another aspect of our technology (now in development) is tracking/measuring/communicating impact created by cutting excess design concepts, thus preventing overproduction. 

In light of the new upcoming legislation in US and EU, we are in the best position to offer a concrete solution as a new process and immutable transparent records via our patent-pending blockchain-based technology.

AS A BRAND:
- Determine beforehand which designs are more likely to become bestsellers 
- Increase your margins by focusing production on popular products only
- Achieve true sustainability while tackling overproduction

AS AN END-CONSUMER: 
- Participate in design selection/ordering before production
- Become Impact Shopper

When Kevin Gray, started GlobeNet back in 2010, he had the idea and feeling that the IT/tech space was missing something. After being in the industry he though the idea of “How can we provide great customer service and great tech solutions at the same time?” as there are not a lot of companies out there that are able to provide both, so since 2010 we feel that we have been able to fill that void.

The idea is we don’t look at ourselves as an IT company, we look at ourselves as a customer service company that happens to provide IT services and world leading partnership solutions which allows your internal team to focus on moving your company forward and at the same time providing solutions that no only save you money and we all know time=money.

We understand what your tech team goes through daily because we are a tech team.

Your success is our success. We live by the mantra, that goes a little something like this, “What is great for our customers is that we work 24/7, the bad thing for us is that we work 24/7”!",,18.0,,,,,,it services and it consulting

Does anyone really believe phone, spreadsheets, and email are the best way to do discovery and scoping? They causes friction with clients, frustrates teams, and doesn’t look professional. It stifles your business and hurts your brand. 

It shouldn't be a struggle that takes weeks or months to get good information. Thirty-tab spreadsheets and boring Zoom calls don't feel professional or produce good results. You need a platform that lets you focus on your business and meet your clients’ expectations from start to finish. 

With Check-It you won't have to piece data together, waste manpower and energy chasing information. You will have a platform designed for your business with intuitive inputs, automation of repetitive tasks and real-time tracking so you can exceed expectations and grow your business.  

Investing in a platform is usually viewed as a cost when the right solution is a vehicle to push you ahead of the competition. When you work hard to create a brand, deliver outstanding work, tools that meet your standards and build trust with your clients, just make sense. 

Envision a smooth process, with targeted assessments that are easy for your team and client to navigate, timelines and scope in check. It represents how professional your organization is. Imagine how clients will see your competitor’s spreadsheets, badgering phone calls and emails, and how broken the process will feel.

Ever find yourself in a business that you shouldn't be in? Many small business owners feel like they have to be experts in everything: accounting, human resources, account management, sales, technology, etc. Many people don't even know that they're in over their head trying to manage their own information technology needs. They don't realize the lost productivity and lost opportunities that come from inefficiently trying to solve technology issues all on their own. 

Remote Techs Inc. is interested in going beyond a problem solver and becoming your full-service IT solution provider. We focus on providing small and medium-sized businesses with the same level of PC support that they would get if they had an entire IT department to themselves. We focus on being a proactive computer support company and not reactive. Our support system puts the ""user-friendly""​ back into your information technology needs.

Business owners come to us when their ""someone that is pretty good at computers""​ is no longer sufficient in covering important technology needs.  Even companies that employ full-time IT professionals turn to us in order to save time and money on managing their IT support.

Over the past decade healthcare has gone through a tremendous amount of technology advancement through digitalization of Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. These systems are a great foundation for documentation, but have forced healthcare practitioners to spend more time looking at a computer screen than at their patients needing care. Both patients and practitioners are frustrated with the amount of data entry processes that they both are required to undergo, much of which are not streamlined or modernized for the 2020s. 

Luxera has spent thousands of hours working directly with practitioners over the course of more than a decade to understand the workflows that enable fast and high quality patient care. These unique insights allow Luxera to build workflows that are modern, yet are fully integrated within the EHR, providing the best of both worlds.

Celere Health addresses these challenges with four areas of emphasis:

  1.	A platform designed to optimize provider workflows, which increases adoption and utilization. A better provider experience ensures better patient experience.
  2.	A user experience specifically designed for vulnerable populations with low technology adoption and their specific clinical conditions.
  3.	A hub and spoke technical architecture ensuring easy adoption and quick integration of third-party monitoring devices.
  4.	Services that fill the staffing gaps of providers and payers to enable 24x7x365 alert management, engagement and response.

This trial by fire forged a strong synergy between the companies and by September of 2017, the Founders of each company were sitting down at a restaurant in Ottawa near Arctic and the talks of a merger came up. After nearly two years of closely supporting one another, it was a natural decision and would help cement the relationship and maximize efficiency and the suite of services both companies could offer.

Netsirv understands that there are no limits. We want our software to stretch and grow with you as your business flourishes.

We are a small, independent, self-directed organization seeking to make the best software for the moving industry. As you grow and change, so can we.

In 1994, David Seeley started Local Motion with a single truck combined with a lot of drive and ambition. After three increasingly successful seasons, David knew it was time to take his business to the next level.

He invested in more trucks, hired more staff and set out to make his company a household name. He also knew that he couldn’t effectively scale his business with post-it-notes, paper and whiteboards. 

David started investing in custom software to better manage and develop his business. In the intervening years the Netsirv team built a Lead Manager, CRM system, Dispatch Order Board, and integrated a GAAP compliant Accounting program into the software. The software is built to automate Lead Parsing, Bank Reconciliation and Accounting. 

In 2011 Netsirv began collaborating with SIRVA. This has led to the integration of QLab, QPD, STS, Camis, Global Com, Billing Downloads and Statement Reconciliation.

With efficient processes, an intuitive interface, and smart, responsive systems, our software allows you to book more moves, reduce overhead, and increase enterprise agility.

Competency Manager Story

As we have gotten to learn about different organizations, during our 18 years of creating custom software products - one thing became clear.

The key to the best organizations were that they had the highest-performing employees. 

We studied this in depth, and found that very few had systematic ways of creating fully trained employees. We knew we could help organizations become more successful, and help their employees realize their full potential.

Competency Manager is an enterprise learning and competency solution that inspires professional development and mitigates compliance risk. To learn more, visit our website cabem.com to see how we can be your solution.

Productivity hasn't improved since 1950 though the cost drivers of labor and materials has increased significantly. If you've purchased and/or remodeled a home in the last 20 years you've experienced the meteoric rise in home prices and/or construction costs. Worse if you're a first time home buyer you may have been forced to the sidelines because of sticker shock.

Thesis: Labor shortages, rising materials cost, and regulation have made home building an onerous process that rolls downhill to buyers in the form of ever-increasing prices. Automating the construction of houses with 3D printing technology at its core is a requirement not only to offset the shortage of labor; but also compensate for the rising cost of materials and regulation. Prices must come down if we want home ownership to remain part of the American Dream.

Current 3D printing technology only addresses part of the home cost problem and even at that they are not the types of homes people have become used to living in. Additionally, simply forming the structure of a house won't get us across the goal line as ""finishing construction""​ is where all the character we desire in a home comes from. Our solution will be driven by beautiful design (emotion) and executed with elegant engineering (objectivity) delivering low overall cost of ownership (value). Creating familiarity will shorten the adoption cycle and speed the pathway to scale.",2018.0,41.0,,Phoenix,,,,construction

Our goal is to make distributed, peer-to-peer computing accessible to everyone.

   We envision a world where users control their own data and privacy. A world where communities create together to produce something better than ever thought possible. 

  Together, we’re building a better world.

About Us: 
Holo is the first step toward a decentralized hosting ecosystem.

Our Story: 
Welcome to a world beyond the bottlenecks of Blockchain. Holo enables scalable, distributed Internet applications and data hosting infrastructures. This allows users to become consenting participants in applications that become communities unto themselves. Built on Holochain, Holo's energy-efficient hosting enables a new class of hosting where individuals are free to buck the $200B cloud hosting industry using simple consumer-grade devices. What's more, hosting on Holo provides incentives (secure cryptocurrency) that reenergizes its user community. Distributed applications can be fit for purpose at any scale. Low infrastructure costs create the revolutionary possibility for funding social networks and other service platforms where users steward their own data. And since any application can interface easily with any other, we envision a vast ecosystem of distributed apps! Security concerns need not undermine these advances, since developers build validation rules that are fit to purpose for a given application to prevent data loss, tampering, or counterfeiting.

For more than 20 years, Consequent has helped many of the best leaders in the world, at companies like Elevance Health, CNA Financial, UPS, United Airlines, Coca-Cola, and other global organizations implement high-stakes initiatives better, faster, and less expensively. We help clients with an array of strategic initiatives, including large technology initiatives, mergers and acquisitions, sustainability and ESG initiatives, organization transformation initiatives, corporate governance (CG) initiatives, cloud migrations and more. If you need to implement a strategic initiative, talk with us first.

Why talk with us? Because successfully implementing strategic initiatives has never been more important – it is how companies win. Unfortunately, most big initiatives don't achieve their original goals (outcome, timeframe, cost, reputation), to the tune of 70% of them failing to deliver on their expectations.

Previously, organizations had only two choices: either do it yourself and ask your team to figure things out (which can cause anxiety and burnout) or hire a large, expensive consulting firm and hand over control while paying them millions of dollars. What if there was a better way?

We’re making it better. 

Remote work and hybrid models are the future. The increased flexibility from hybrid models creates tremendous benefits for freelance developers and companies alike, but the path to get there isn’t always clear. We’re building Torc because we believe work can be better: more productive, more free, and more secure. For everyone.

Torc is a talent marketplace bringing the most productive freelance developers to the enterprise through an AI, security, and culture-first platform approach. 

Why AI?
Using AI and automation to intelligently match developers with the companies that need them is only the first step. Torc is pioneering the use of data to understand and measure developer productivity. Customers want to understand productivity to manage teams more effectively, and the best developers want to understand it to upskill themselves and be recognized.

Why security?
Torc is designed for enterprise customers. Our team has been doing this for two-decades, not two-years. We know the needs of procurement, HR, legal, and security are distinctly different at large companies. We use simplicity, automation, and technology to overcome the biggest roadblocks to using freelance developers.

Why culture?
Top enterprise software developers are deserting traditional employment in droves for more flexibility, more personalization, and more control over their careers. Our hands-on, community approach is designed to support freelancers in building successful careers as freelance developers, not just finding the next job. Torc is a Community of talent, not just a roster of talent. 

Torc is led by pioneers in the area of distributed talent models, including leaders from Topcoder, Deloitte, Cognizant, Catalant, Atomic Ventures, and Harvard.",,31.0,,,,,,internet marketplace platforms

Only half of US alumni strongly agree their education was worth the cost. The way students value and experience their education has changed. They have new expectations:

- Job outcomes, not just a degree
- Social and digital, not isolated and static
- Experiential, not theoretical

Meanwhile, supportive relationships most influenced, even doubled, graduates’ perception that their education was worth the cost. We believe relationships and community are key to student success and engaged alumni.

Turn connections into opportunity. PeopleGrove helps institutions bring personalized, mentor-focused communities to students and alumni from enrollment to long after graduation.

PeopleGrove connects every student and all alumni with the network and resources they need to realize their full potential before, during, and after their time in college. Founded in 2015, PeopleGrove works with over 300 institutions worldwide, including Stanford University, the University of Michigan, Wellesley College, and the University of Maryland Global Campus. PeopleGrove is the recipient of prestigious industry accolades, including the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing companies and the Forbes 30 Under 30 list of young entrepreneurs.

With our Cybersecurity Risk Assessment, small businesses can eliminate risk and exposure to cyber criminals and Hackers.  A formal, Written Information Security Plan brings compliance into play, ensuring your Cyber Insurance Claim is covered.  We also provide periodic Health Checks and Security Awareness Training.  Our decades of experience means you get competent personal attention and reliable service.

Small and medium-sized businesses are learning that a successful attack on their computers, software and/or data can be devastating.  Big companies have invested millions in security measures and chances are good that smaller businesses are not nearly as well protected. That makes a small business a much easier target. And believe it or not, your business’ data is just as valuable to criminals.   

At the same time, security has grown increasingly complex, with layers of protection required to withstand rapidly evolving types of attacks. There’s also far more to protect than in the past. There’s more data, more apps in the cloud, more mobile devices than ever and they all need protection against threats that change rapidly.

Digital Tech Partners brings over 60 Years of experience to your company.  Experience that translates into affordable, personal service that combines technical expertise with best-inbreed solutions and tools.

Cybersecurity is the combination of technology, people and processes to protect your digital assets such as the credentials to your company’s bank accounts.

Wilson Hill Academy exists to provide college-bound students with a classical and Christian education founded upon and informed by a biblical worldview; equipping them to know, love, and practice that which is true, good and beautiful, and preparing them to live obedient, fruitful lives in the service of God and man.

OUR PHILOSOPHY
Wilson Hill Academy believes that gifted, enthusiastic teachers who can bring their subjects alive are the key to successfully delivering a classical Christian education, whether online or in a classroom.  At WHA you will find teachers who truly love their subjects and who have thought deeply about the way God is revealed in and through the various academic disciplines.  But first and foremost, they are men and women who will “consider not only their own interests, but also the interests of (the students)”, and who model Christ-likeness in all that they do.

CLASSICAL CHRISTIAN EDUCATION
A classical Christian education is first of all Christian. It is a pursuit of all that is good, true and beautiful with the recognition that truth, goodness and beauty are absolutes rooted in the triune God of Scripture. It is also classical in the sense that it seeks to equip students with the tools of learning and a worldview framework within which to pursue life-long learning. And finally it is forward-looking – equipping students to face the challenges of the 3rd millennium armed with wisdom from the previous two.

ACADEMICS
Wilson Hill Academy teaches from the perspective of an integrated whole in which absolute truth, goodness and beauty are rooted in the character of God.  All courses are designed to equip students with tools of learning they can apply beyond the boundaries of any individual classroom.  True education is more about considering questions than memorizing answers, so while the content in each course is important, students can expect to learn how to grapple with that content, not just remember it until test time.

There was no all-in-one solution to help service providers manage a high volume of work orders, B2B and B2C customers, and both vendors and in-house technicians; business owners were having to piece together a solution from the variety of software on the market that tackled one, but not all, of their issues, severely limiting their productivity, efficiency, and profitability.

Field Service Software would require a continuously updatable platform that allows our clients to expand without being held back by the limitations of the software, but instead be empowered by its flexibility which enables and motivates expansion, automation, and error preventative operations.

In order to fill this gap, we partnered with a development team to create an all-in-one software solution that addressed each of these operational issues and offered an easy-to-manage and customizable platform for service providers.

Our software was created with the support of clients, office personnel, technicians, and contractors in the field who offered real-time feedback that was used to shape the software to best fit each need.

This not only insured the practical and competitive edge of our software but also brought us to a realization that the next generation.

Alongside classwork, Cipher Tech began to bridge the gap between the nation’s best academics and students, and the defense community. Just a few years later, in true “David and Goliath” fashion, Cipher Tech became known as a fierce competitor by defense and intelligence firms many times our size.

Today we, as a company, take great pride in supporting many of the most mission critical projects within the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The majority of the company is comprised of extremely talented software developers who write production tools that directly support one of two missions: digital forensics and malware reverse engineering.

Digital forensics is the application of computer science and investigative procedures involving the examination of digital evidence. This includes extracting and processing evidence from computers, phones, tablets, cameras, flash-drives, and just about any other form of digital media. The results of our work are then used to support federal and military law enforcement, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorist activities.

Malware reverse engineering is the practice of analyzing extremely advanced malicious code. The goal of a reverse engineer is to understand how the malicious code is working and determine things like: how it infected the victim’s computer; what kind of information is it seeking to steal; how is it communicating with the actor; and who that actor might be.

Our rigorous hiring processes and extremely flat organizational chart have been critical to the company's success.

XLEMR can be downloaded and installed in about 15 minutes. Customization and implementation is progressive and done at a pace the provider and staff are comfortable with.
 Forget high price tags. The XLEMR solution costs less to operate than most because we designed it on the most prolific system available, not a proprietary system. The only requirements are your practice are a computer installed with at least Windows 2000 and Office 2000. You don't have to purchase and support sophisticated servers, databases, and backup systems.
 XLEMR was the 2nd EMR to be certified and the 1st EMR to automatically submit production data to QNET on a daily basis (Government funded program).
 Because it runs on MS Office and the Windows file system, only very basic knowledge is required to be proficient. Any training that you do need is included in the purchase price. 
 LAN's make workflow easier, and XLEMR does utilize LANs in our solution. However, we do not require a LAN for this product to function. If your LAN fails, patients' charts are simply copied to USB ""Jump"" drives and given to the patient to take with them as they navigate the workflow of the office.
 Unlike most other EMRs, we do not depend upon a database to see patients. We have databases to support reporting and analysis, but the EMR does not require access to them to function.
 Some EMRs require kiosks, special tablets or handhelds, or the specific make and model of special devices like digital X-ray equipment. XLEMR's solution runs on computer equipment already in the office, saving you major investments.

As it usually happens, success brings more work and we've been lucky enough to be recognised by our clients, so that our team grew six-fold in two years. We took on more projects and built dedicated teams for Cloud Applications Development, Cloud Migration and Business Applications with focus on Tableau. We now manage and support products and applications that operate in the United Kingdom as well as in France, Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.

Our headquarters is in the beautiful seaside town of Varna in Bulgaria but our team members are mostly remote and work from various places such as the town of Plovdiv and the capital Sofia. Our sales and operations office is in the town of Reading in the United Kingdom. We pride ourselves on being able to make remote teams work which also enables us to find the best talent without being limited to specific locations.

No company overview would be complete without dropping some core values.

Developed by a team of founders with collectively over 30 years of experience in real estate, property maintenance, building, and development, FieldComplete was created to fill a widening gap in the market between what service providers needed to be successful and the tools available to help them manage their businesses.

There was no all-in-one solution to help service providers manage a high volume of work orders, B2B and B2C customers, and both vendors and in-house technicians; business owners were having to piece together a solution from the variety of software on the market that tackled one, but not all, of their issues, severely limiting their productivity, efficiency, and profitability.

Field Service Software would require a continuously updatable platform that allows our clients to expand without being held back by the limitations of the software, but instead be empowered by its flexibility which enables and motivates expansion, automation, and error preventative operations.

In order to fill this gap, we partnered with a development team to create an all-in-one software solution that addressed each of these operational issues and offered an easy-to-manage and customizable platform for service providers.

Our software was created with the support of clients, office personnel, technicians, and contractors in the field who offered real-time feedback that was used to shape the software to best fit each need.

This not only insured the practical and competitive edge of our software but also brought us to a realization that the next generation.

FieldComplete is the end result of our efforts and offers the only all-in-one software solution for service providers on the market today.

Over the course of 2018, as Synoptic grew into its role as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and matured its offerings, it was able to fully absorb the functions and mission of Synoptic Labs, which was incrementally retired over that same period.

Those who passionately believe in the future of credit unions – that the best years are yet to come instead of behind them.

Delivering on our commitment to improve quality of life by changing the way healthcare is delivered, our multidisciplinary team of scientists, clinicians, engineers, and software architects has developed the Intra-Operative Positioning System (IOPS™). This mobile and affordable GPS-like 3D vascular navigation system allows for greater surgical precision and control than ever before, improving device placement accuracy, simplifying complex procedures, and potentially decreasing endoleaks and costly secondary interventions.

Millions of vascular procedures are performed each year with minimally invasive, endovascular procedures frequently preferred over open surgical repair. Currently, to navigate within vessels physicians rely on x-ray fluoroscopy. This technology has several critical limitations, including lack of soft tissue visualization and exposure to harmful ionizing radiation. IOPS™, which fits directly into existing workflows and operating rooms, eliminates this excessive radiation exposure by creating manipulable 3D models of the relevant anatomy. These intelligent models are created from existing imaging that is already part of the standard of care. 

Centerline Biomedical, Inc. was founded in 2014 as a spinoff of the Cleveland Clinic to commercialize our innovative vascular navigation technology. With a research, development, and design history rooted in the Clinic’s world-class Lerner Research Institute’s Heart and Vascular Institute, the IOPS™ platform can be further used for predictive modeling, clinical decision support, global healthcare analytics and the education and training of future surgeons and interventionists.

We strengthen community-oriented financial institutions with state-of-the-art technology that enhances in-market relationship banking. Efficiencies naturally result from cloud-based, mobile first approaches.
We Believe...

- Community banking is a fundamental building block of America’s economy;

- Community banking is not about a size, it is about a way of doing business;

- Community banker’s competitive advantage is delivered through personal relationships, physical presence, and timely and effective decisions;

- Time spent maintaining traditional, cumbersome banking processes increases risk, diminishes efficiency, and is a misuse of valuable time that could otherwise be spent developing the personal relationships vital to the community bank.

- Web-based, real time, mobile-capable tools that support community bankers, at the banker’s hand at all times and places, are absolutely vital to your competitive advantage.

- The rising wave of challenges from out of market banks, non-bank entities, and regulatory compliance are existential competitive threats.  Traditional technology has lagged far behind these threats.  BankLabs gives community bankers the tools to compete and win in today’s – and tomorrow’s – world.

Our leadership team includes top neuroscientists from DARPA and senior business executives who previously built five very successful companies.

Optios’ scientific research arm is dedicated to evaluating and developing peak performance neurotechnologies. Multiple recent scientific breakthroughs in neuroscience, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and psychology have all enabled dramatic enhancements in human performance, health and longevity.

Optios seeks to be a curator in this rapidly expanding field and thereby separate science from science fiction. To that end, we rigorously and objectively evaluate a broad range of performance optimization approaches to identify what works to improve performance, and what doesn’t. The neuroscientists at Optios share their findings through research reports and comprehensive programs to empower individuals and organizations to optimize their performance.

Our premise is that every individual has an untapped capacity for change and growth. Our objective is to enable high performers to measure what matters to performance and then apply scientifically validated techniques to optimize their performance, enabling them to become the best version of themselves.

We've built the GHX Global Network, the world's largest community of healthcare trading partners, connecting supply chain, finance and clinical professionals with their suppliers. Our cloud-based technology makes it easier for customers to drive costs out of the healthcare supply chain. Since 2010, we've saved the healthcare industry $5+ billion. Today we're expanding our solutions to further enhance data management and allow integration of clinical and business systems.

The Industry We Serve
Our focus is on the healthcare supply chain, through which hospitals and their suppliers buy and deliver the thousands of medical-surgical supplies that clinicians need to effectively care for patients. For most hospitals, supply chain costs are the second largest and fastest growing operational expense, so reining in these costs is imperative. 

Our Products and Services
At the heart of GHX is the GHX Exchange, a platform that connects healthcare providers and suppliers so they can work together electronically. This helps lower costs and simplifies supply chain management by eliminating error-prone, manual order processes. 

GHX solutions include:
•	An open and neutral electronic trading exchange
•	Procurement and accounts payable automation
•	Content, contract and inventory management
•	Business intelligence and reporting
•	Standards enablement and data synchronization",2000.0,1500.0,,Louisville,"1315 west century drive, louisville, colorado, united states",80027,+17208877000,hospital and health care

This never-ending search reduces team member capacity, engagement, and overall satisfaction, and is simply unacceptable in today’s workplace.

Since 1977, the Phoenix Society has partnered with survivors, families, health care professionals, burn centers, and the fire industry to support recovery, improve the quality of burn care, and prevent burn injury. Today, the Phoenix Society is the leading national nonprofit organization committed to empowering anyone affected by a burn injury.  

Over the years, the Phoenix Society has developed a variety of programs: Phoenix SOAR®, Phoenix World Burn Congress®, Phoenix Online Community, Phoenix Advocates, Phoenix Education Grants, Burn Support Magazine and more! We created these programs to help the burn survivor community heal physically, emotionally, and socially. Healing from a burn injury is a lifelong journey, so we've developed innovative plans that will be there at every step of the way. 

For example, Phoenix SOAR connects burn survivors and loved ones to a compassionate community of people who share the experience of a burn injury, helping them find hope and healing through peer support. Phoenix Society created Phoenix SOAR in conjunction with a national committee of experts, which led to the inclusion of aftercare and peer support in the American Burn Association’s national burn center verification criteria.

Furthermore, the Phoenix Society is a key partner in developing the groundbreaking LIBRE (Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation) Profile, a self-advocacy tool for burn survivors and a valuable means of gathering data about the long-term impact of a burn injury. Already, the LIBRE Profile has led to the first quantitative evidence that peer support results in improved outcomes for survivors.

But some things won't ever change: Our entrepreneurial spirit and a culture where everyone's opinion matters. That's because we believe it's possible to light the tech world on fire and still be on a first name basis.

BIG IDEAS, SMALL EGOS
What we do best is make products that let our customers do what they love. To do that, we focus on practical innovation, never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers. Sure, we love bells and whistles. What leading technology company doesn't? But we make sure ours have purpose. It's not about the things we make. It's about the things we make possible.

WE'RE GLOBAL, SERIOUSLY.
Yeah, we're based in Kansas City, but we are truly a global company. With offices throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia, our products are sold all over the world. One elevator ride at our headquarters and you're likely to hear 4 (or more) different languages being spoken. At Garmin, we may act local, but we think global.

DREAM BIG. SLEEP WELL.
At Garmin, we like to encourage dreamers. But at some point it's nice to wake up and enjoy a fully aware life. So we make it super easy to achieve a good balance between working, dreaming and enjoying life—from workout classes offered throughout the day, breaks to get out and move on our campus, and wellness programs offered throughout the year.
