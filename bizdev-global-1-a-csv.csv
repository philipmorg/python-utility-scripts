Costa Rica is ranked as the #2 most innovative economy in Latin America by the Global Innovation Index.  Technology has been an integral part of education in Costa Rica since 1987.  Costa Rica’s commitment to innovation is reflected in the development of technology parks utilized by top companies including IBM, Microsoft, VMWare, and many others.

Because of Costa Rica’s geographical proximity to the United States and overlapping time zones (CST), real-time communication is possible, with little to no latency.  Same travel and same-day work are possible with regular flights from San Jose CR to the U.S.

Costa Rica’s workforce is highly educated and fluent in both Spanish and English.  Costa Ricans have a strong work ethic.  The 22 Universities and colleges reflect the value that Costa Rican’s place on higher education.  

Intellectual property laws are strong in Costa Rica.  Adherence to IP laws, the enforcement of trademarks, patents and copyrights means that your intellectual property is safe.  

The cost of software development is significantly less expensive in Costa Rica than in the United States.

+ de flexibilité grâce à une meilleure visibilité
+ de sens en redonnant la maîtrise au personnel soignant
+ de responsabilité de chaque opérateur en étant partie prenante du flux et du parcours patient

Silbo est une véritable tour de contrôle, connectée au système d'information, pour la gestion et l’optimisation des étapes du parcours patient :
* Collaborer avec d'autres établissements grâce à la vision territoriale de la gestion des lits et le transport sanitaire
* Fluidifier les transferts des urgences vers les services d’aval
* Optimiser le placement des patients hospitalisés dans les services d’aval
* Gérer les hébergements et les transferts entre unités
* Piloter, optimiser et anticiper la chaine du parcours patient : brancardage, bio nettoyage, transports sanitaires
* Piloter et planifier le bloc opératoire et son brancardage
* Coordonner les sorties de patients vers les établissements de prise en charge spécifiques grâce à la gestion territoriale des lits et au transport sanitaire
* Exporter les données vers le ROR
* Automatiser les flux grâce au connexions avec le SIH et nos algorithmes de placement automatique

Notre méthodologie itérative se base sur une écoute attentive des établissements afin de développer des solutions qui répondent réellement aux besoins des soignants.

Silbo optimise la gestion des flux patients en France (et bientôt en Europe 👊), grâce à une équipe soudée et réunie autour d’une mission “servir ceux qui soignent en simplifiant leur quotidien”.

We do this by hiring great people and being committed to the highest standards of excellence. Our goal is to be different and better.

Together with our clients we build custom software solutions. Those solutions are diverse in their form and function as are the industries in which they are used. What is common to all is the business value they drive for the clients for whom they were constructed.

Our solutions are most often in the following categories:

 • Web applications
 • Desktop applications
 • Mobile applications
 • Data and Big Data
 • Reporting and Business Intelligence

Different and Better

The world is filled with service providers making oversize promises at minuscule prices. Too often collaborations struggle or fail to live up to expectations and real ROI is not realized. At RIA Solutions Group we are committed not only to technical expertise but also to the non-technical attributes which are essential to being an excellent partner for software development.

 • Excellent Communication
 Excellent communication skills are essential for an efficient collaboration. All our remote personnel are highly capable in written and verbal communication.
 • Delivering Quality
 Delivering quality is a top goal. We have high standards for quality and reach those through code reviews, unit testing, static analysis, manual and automatic testing.
 • Smooth and Effective Collaboration

***Codup focuses on 3 key areas of expertise***

Ecommmerce Solutions: Our deep industry knowledge positions us well to be a technology partner to e-commerce companies that want to focus purely on business and not worry about technology.

Product Development: Developing a successful product is more about shipping fast and engaging your users rather than building a massive feature set out of the gate. Not only can we help you make sense of technology and handle it for you, we can help you make smart compromises and trade-offs so you can keep going forward. 

Systems Integeration: Systems integrations have evolved in nature and given birth to the API economy. Codup can help leverage this new trend for massive cost and efficiency benefits while still enjoying perfect harmony of data among your various software suites.

***What our clients get by working with us***

Exceptional Communication: One of the biggest challenges for outsourcing to the South Asian region is communication. At a time when Collaboration and Clear Communication is becoming increasingly important for success of projects among distributed teams, most companies fare poorly at it. With Codup however, clear and upfront communication is king and it culminates into successful projects all the time.

Mature Processes: We have mature business processes in place that ensure successful understanding and delivery of projects. Each project goes through the following phases; requirements and analysis, estimations, scoping, design, development, testing, UAT, deployment, maintenance and support. 

Deep Understanding: Having had several medium and large projects under our belt, our team has a deep understanding of the domains we operate in.

***Codup focuses on 3 key areas of expertise***

Ecommmerce Solutions: Our deep industry knowledge positions us well to be a technology partner to e-commerce companies that want to focus purely on business and not worry about technology.

Product Development: Developing a successful product is more about shipping fast and engaging your users rather than building a massive feature set out of the gate. Not only can we help you make sense of technology and handle it for you, we can help you make smart compromises and trade-offs so you can keep going forward. 

Systems Integeration: Systems integrations have evolved in nature and given birth to the API economy. Codup can help leverage this new trend for massive cost and efficiency benefits while still enjoying perfect harmony of data among your various software suites.

***What our clients get by working with us***

Exceptional Communication: One of the biggest challenges for outsourcing to the South Asian region is communication. At a time when Collaboration and Clear Communication is becoming increasingly important for success of projects among distributed teams, most companies fare poorly at it. With Codup however, clear and upfront communication is king and it culminates into successful projects all the time.

Mature Processes: We have mature business processes in place that ensure successful understanding and delivery of projects. Each project goes through the following phases; requirements and analysis, estimations, scoping, design, development, testing, UAT, deployment, maintenance and support. 

Deep Understanding: Having had several medium and large projects under our belt, our team has a deep understanding of the domains we operate in.

Our Blue Goose Platform is a stand-alone Accounting and Policy Management platform designed specifically for MGAs, Program Administrators, Wholesalers, and Small Carriers to better manage workflow, policy administration, document management, and accounting.   
 
THE BLUE GOOSE PLATFORM 
Main functions: 
 
▪️Policy Administration and Underwriting Workflow- Rules-based workflow engineering that automates and tracks submission, clearance, quoting, binding and policy issuance.  And, whether it’s your solution or ours, we can integrate with any system using our out-of-the-box API.

▪️AR, AP, and GL System- Stand-alone system accommodates agency bill, carrier billing to insured, or when you bill insured. Handles tax reporting and generates easy-to-read agent, account, and broker statements. 

▪️Document Management- Intelligent document management integrated into our policy management systems to manage all of your data, including scans, emails, Word and Excel documents, faxes, photography, policies, and claims –all in one location. 
 
Many clients we meet have older legacy or less robust systems built for smaller retail agencies.  Others have the newer no/low code systems, which don’t include general ledger and accounting support.
 
These systems often lack processing or integration capabilities and can’t fully accommodate the needs of MGAs, Program Administrators, or Wholesalers without expensive and difficult customization.  
 
At Blue Goose, our breakthrough technology is designed specifically for today's demanding workloads without extensive programming changes. We offer out-of-the-box usability that can be quickly configured to meet any of your needs and help you streamline all of your accounting, policy, and document management processes.

What is our competitive edge?

Our clients can combine modules to integrate various aspects of risk management into a single software platform, achieving what we call ""Software Singularity"". 

Software Singularity represents having a single source of information to eliminate redundancy across different data sources, to maintain data integrity and consistency.

Founded in 2001 in Santa Cruz, CA and has built custom proprietary risk management software systems  through 2008. In 2010, A1 developed and released A1 Tracker with the 1st module.

We know that the software adoption process can be complex, with many moving parts and parties involved. While implementing custom web-based solutions over our 1st 10 years, cloud software matured. We observed a strong need for a software product with more flexibility as to integrate with and serve multiple departmental needs.

We therefore invested the knowledge and lessons gained over our 1st 10 years into A1 Tracker and the robust and dynamic architecture that drives it.

A1 Enterprise strengths extend far beyond the product offered. The investment into the  implementation process sets the stage for how well the software supports the business and how receptive users are to using the software. and ultimately our customers' ROI.

Observing our clients were dealing with multiple products from different vendors, we saw very long implementation cycles, project overruns and unsatisfying end-results as the main hurdles to transaction processing.

We developed a holistic transaction processing solution called IMS. The application combined several processing modules, supporting components and connectivity services and took the complete life cycle of a transaction, rather than addressing the needs of a specific business division.

This way, Cleo creates value by empowering organizations to drive business agility, accelerate onboarding, facilitate modernization of key business processes, and capture new revenue streams by reimagining and remastering their B2B, application, and data integrations.

How we do it

Our hybrid customer experience platform powers the entire customer journey from online discovery, to store visit, to recommendation and repeat purchase. 

Why we're different

We could talk about how we have the best UX, are trusted by the world's top brands, and manage more than a million locations. But what we pride ourselves on is delivering a stand-out experience for our customers, just as they do for their customers. 

We don't focus only on visibility or reputation; we help brick and mortar businesses master the entire hybrid customer experience, simply and at scale. We don't use dubious sales and pricing tactics; we include the things that matter —and not those that don't — right from the start.

Why it matters

We make sure your business is not only found, but attracts and delights customers on every corner, across the globe - driving revenue and customer lifetime value, at scale.

Key Modules

Each part of the Uberall platform works together to get your business found, but the heavy lifters are: 

Listings: ​​Gather all your business listings under one roof and publish your location data to 125+ publishers. Enrich and update all your listings simultaneously and in real-time.

Reviews: Manage and reply to customer feedback at scale, to not only level up your chances of showing up in local searches, but of landing local sales.

Don’t Start Over — Remodel Your Code.
It’s common to hear developers recommend scrapping an existing application and building it over from scratch. Sometimes this makes sense, but often it’s more cost effective to improve what you already have. Would you tear down your house if all you wanted to do was update your kitchen or add on a sunroom? No, you’d remodel what’s already there. Learn more about our remodeling and retrofitting services.

This unique concept utilizes short-form video and offers businesses the opportunity to interact with their audience more directly, selectively and intimately providing measurable results. 

URated was developed from an idea that would see ‘real’ reviews by ‘real’ people – not actors. Offering reviews of restaurants, hotels, events, and pretty much everything else, URated gives users the ‘real’ goods on what to expect when they decide to spend their money on a variety of experiences, goods and services.

For more than a decade, we’ve helped over 100 companies to realize the full benefits of simulation.

VCollab automates the process of extracting, merging, and reporting simulation insights in 3D, high-fidelity, browser-viewable model-based simulation story boards, expanding access to critical simulation insights to everyone involved in design and manufacturing. 

Making actionable insights widely available leads to better and faster engineering decisions ― which leads to better products.

VCollab also saves valuable simulation analyst time by eliminating the need for manually-created, 2D simulation reports. Developing simulation reports for engineers who lack the access and skills to use native simulation tools not only wastes time, it substantially reduces the simulation information available to non-analysts.

With VCollab, report generation is automated, reducing the time to create & modify from days to minutes, while expanding access to high-fidelity 3D simulation insights to anyone in your organization or supply chain. 

And we make this possible with products that can be implemented in days, not weeks or months.

Our Story

Our founders, Bill and Amanda Bennett, moved to Kigali, Rwanda in 2013 with the broad and ambitious goal of engaging with the developing world for good. Bill leveraged his experience as a software engineer and business analyst to help Rwanda Trading Company work more effectively and extend its positive impact with local coffee farmers. Inspired by the success of this initial project, Bill began hiring and training local developers in order to take on additional projects. Now headquartered in the U.S. in Cincinnati, OH, Kiza Solutions continues to have a primary office of developers based in Kigali, Rwanda while the team has expanded to include developers in other African countries as well.

Support
Our partners receive vital assistance with back-end functionality so they can focus on what they do best – delivering exceptional patient care. We offer NCQA/PCMH certification, accounting and financial services, analytical and quality reporting, malpractice support and human resources benefits. In addition, we leverage our strong relationships with insurers for the benefit of all of our practices, allowing them to focus on delivering the best care possible.

Innovation
Allied Physicians Group is committed to staying at the forefront of all things digital, offering our physicians the most cutting-edge capabilities and technologies. We continually search for new, innovative approaches to the practice of medicine so you don’t have to. Allied’s use of centralized, physician-customized EMR, along with our point-of-care Quality Improvement Program, will allow your practice to become more efficient and provide a higher quality of patient care.

One example of the innovation we offer our physicians is through access to Phreesia, the best-in-class digital platform that has re-designed medical office workflow for the 21st century. Phreesia streamlines patient check-in, automates insurance verification, improves collections and gives both physician practices and patients access to customer service 24/7.

Collaboration
At Allied, we have created an environment where each physicians voice is heard and decisions are made by doctors, not by an outside committee, with consultation from business, management and IT professionals, and executed as the physician deems necessary.

We help businesses scale their pipeline through Signal Intelligence by addressing the most common yet unanswered challenges that most sellers have. 

How do you meet quotas regularly, make the most of your sellers’ resources, time, and energy, and grow your pipeline at scale? Companies and sales teams will often go to lead generation experts, who can give them names and prospects to go after. And this is all good and fine.

However, what sets us apart from these companies is that we offer a complete managed service that mines data from both your target and existing accounts. Based on this data, we provide you with actionable Signals that can save your sellers a lot of time. The time they’d usually spend researching and prospecting can now be used in the things they’re really excellent at -- Selling.

Besides account monitoring, we also map your total addressable market, giving you valuable insights on where you can expand your pipeline, existing networks you can leverage, and other verticals that you can tap into. This is one of the most important things that a seller can do before diving into prospecting. Having a solid picture of your market gives you the opportunity to prepare accordingly for the people and networks that you’ll be interacting with and selling to.

Your salesmen aren’t trained to research. They’re trained to sell. Let them do that. Leave the research and other tedious tasks that go along with prospecting up to us. You can trust that we will come up with curated and timely Signals for you in a way that’s proven to help you enter accounts faster, find new sales opportunities, and increase your pipeline at scale.

We work to transform both your sales and customer experience, transcending the status quo of your industry or category. The result is richer customer engagement, deepened loyalty, reduced operational cost and accelerated revenue growth.

It has been said that you can define who you are by stating who you are not. We are not a business strategy firm. We are not an advertising or branding agency. We are not an information technology company. Yet we draw on all three of these disciplines to design Customer Resonance in what has been traditionally called Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

Most CRM implementations fail. We think that is a shame. The technology has been around for over a decade and the platform is mature. We’re here to change that statistic. CRM failures have much less to do with incapable technology, but rather flaws in the strategy (or the lack thereof), the ownership (or the lack thereof), the expectations or the implementation approach. We believe this is due to a technology based approach to CRM. CRM is not a technology, it is a belief, it is a mindset, and it is a pervasive, disruptive and positive transformation that can be enabled through technology.

We founded Frequency Foundry with the idea of combining a left-brain technical approach with a right-brain creative perspective to form a holistic view to designing business development and customer strategies that utilize CRM technology. As a result, we have a passion and an aptitude for business strategy, brand strategy, user experience design, consumer research and CRM technology development and implementation.

Levitek was formed with a specific goal of tackling a challenging problem faced by many companies in the Design-Manufacturing industry that uses Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) or Product Data Management (PDM) systems. These systems are used in managing the entire lifecycle of a product from inception, through engineering design and manufacture, to service and disposal of manufactured products. As companies grow and evolve, there is a need for changing PLM systems for various reasons. In other cases, vast amounts of engineering data need to be consolidated into a single system after a merger/acquisition or to achieve enterprise-wide standardization across multiple business units. This requires migrating/merging complex engineering data across PDM/PLM systems. Levitek primarily specializes in solving this problem by combining its proprietary Data Migration Platform, processes, and a team of subject matter experts. Levitek also offers solutions for system integrations, CAD/PLM/PDM customizations, and CAD migrations.

‘Google’ is not just a noun anymore, it’s an action verb that means looking up something on the internet. A regular consumer will not make even a small purchase today, or deal with a company in any manner, without ‘googling’ them first. This can be tricky! A bad Online Reputation can have long-lasting negative results on any company’s business. Sadly, there is no way of stopping these negativities, and Google’s search algorithm will bring up all kinds of negatives when a consumer goes looking for them. Here comes in the job of an ORM Expert.

An ORM Expert actively monitors any kind of negative news, reviews, etc that may be floating around the internet regarding a company. It’s this Expert’s job to Improve Your Online Reputation & Proper Management, the said Company’s Online Reputation. A Good Online Reputation can take any business miles ahead. Not only does it lead to good monetary results, but it also helps with the company’s Online Presence in general. The company’s first few Google search pages will cover all the positive news which will, in turn, result in being extremely profitable for the company.

Our aim here is to make sure our Client’s Online Reputations are well taken care of. No negative news can and should hamper a business's growth. We understand that having a Good Online Reputation Management is so much more than just hiring a good web designer. It goes well beyond that. It also includes factors such as SEO and efficient Digital Marketing. These couple of factors with a good ORM Expert by your side, take your business to unimaginable greater heights.

So if you’re a business owner, hire an ORM Expert today before it’s too late. No amateur can do what a professional does and this is definitely a task that can only be managed successfully by an expert in the field, with years of work experience under their belt.

The World's Most Legendary Racetrack®
Known as the home of the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks, Churchill Downs Racetrack conducts Thoroughbred horse racing in Louisville, Kentucky during three race meets in the Spring, September, and the Fall. The racetrack occupies 147 acres, featuring a one-mile dirt, oval racetrack and a seven furlong turf race course. Thoroughbred racing, the Kentucky Derby, and the Kentucky Oaks have run continuously at Churchill Downs Racetrack since 1875. In addition, Churchill Downs Racetrack has hosted the Breeders' Cup World Championship eight times.

Over the course of three centuries, the track has completed several massive renovation projects to modernize its venerable grandstand and clubhouse and to accommodate its more than 165,000 guests on Kentucky Derby Day. Modernization projects have included the construction of private luxury suites and integrated simulcast areas, the installation of permanent lights to operate night-time race programs, and building The Big Board – the world's largest 4k video screen. The Twin Spires that sit atop the grandstands remain the most recognizable architectural feature of Churchill Downs and serve as a symbol of the racetrack. The spires were designed by architect Joseph Dominic Baldez and were built in 1895 – they shine across the world's most legendary racetrack each night.",1875,120,,Louisville,"700 central ave, louisville, kentucky, united states, 40208",40208,5026364400,sports

Between the founders and subsequent employees, CrossConcept has centuries of combined experience helping service organizations automate their processes. Clients have ranged in size from a handful of people to over thirty thousand, but the challenges are always similar: 

° Excessive software complexity and unwanted features

° Software that demands more discipline than the organization's maturity supports 

° A focus on processes for the back office, not the front-line worker

CrossConcept launched our Continuum PSA SaaS solution in 2017 explicitly to address these issues. It contains a carefully curated feature set with only the tools that service organizations actually use. Its user interface is laser-focused on minimizing clicks and on being intuitive. Front-line employees find it helpful to their personal needs, rather than an imposition by the back office. This focus on effective simplicity colors not only the CrossConcept Continuum product but all aspects of doing business with our company. For example, it is evident in the simplicity of our pricing structure, or in the ease (self-service) with which our customers can adjust license counts in real-time as their headcounts go up or down

In 2018, CrossConcept's amazing work was recognized by both the TopChoiceAwards and ThreeBestRated for their innovative mindset and outstanding service. CrossConcept took home the award for ""Best IT Service""​ from both awarding companies.",2010,13,,,,,8885283898,"it services and it consulting"

How we make this happen:
We bridge the talent gap by innovating technologies and processes that combat recruitment biases.
We remove obstacles that prevent connecting diverse talents to global work opportunities, mitigate risks, carry on liability, and build trust resulting in a handshake between all stakeholders.

This is what you gain from it:
We at Zarttech can help you scale your business with senior IT Experts from diverse global backgrounds (Africa, Europe, and South America). Zarttech can also help get your IT project done quickly and efficiently while making a social impact individually and collectively.

We provide you with the best hand-picked Senior IT Experts within 24 hours if needed.
Our focus is on two main services: Outstaffing and Outsourcing.
Outstaffing:
We provide IT Experts to join your team on a fully remote, hybrid-remote, or onsite basis. They will work under your supervision. Zarttech employs all IT Experts, and after a duration of time of staffing through Zarttech, businesses can directly hire such talent or team when trust is built. As a result, our team will become part of your team.

Outsourcing:
You provide us with your project. Our expert(s) realise the solution using the highest quality agile practices. We also offer outsourcing services for custom software development projects where the Senior Experts are working, employed, and led by Zarttech.

Our Foundation
At Zarttech, we always pay it forward. Beyond the butterfly effect that positively impacts the global economy when you hire from us, our foundation is dedicated to educating more women tech talents in Africa.
Every year 2% of our revenue is donated to our foundation; this revenue is focused on training 2000 women in tech in the next five years in Africa, contributing to ESG.

Making digital accessible to all would increase professional opportunities, the well-being of the inhabitants, facilitate interactions with the administration and stimulate economic dynamism. There are gaps that need to be filled in order for there to be inclusion: increasing computer access to digital and internet; improving IT skills; improving the use and ability to appropriate content made accessible by ICT. The need for the improvement of citizens' digital skills is growing.

The European Commission's Plan for 2021-2027 focuses on strengthening the EU's use of new technologies and digital tools for integration and inclusion. The latter recognizes the importance of education in order to equip migrants with the appropriate and necessary skills to achieve personal fulfilment, find employment, impart the values of their home societies, as well as participate within the culture and learn the language for their integration. The need to have education and training programs for migrants to be more involved and to integrate into their respective societies.

A key policy goal of the EU Digital Single Market Strategy is that citizens and businesses can take full advantage of the opportunities that digitalisation can offer. Digital Hubs can help this goal, by ensuring access to digital technology, developing digital skills and improving opportunities for business collaboration and growth.

Back in 2018, we saw everything crash and burn as one of our biggest projects was failing. As a result of this failure, we learned how to transform and scale our business.

First, we’ve transformed our own 2 local businesses with over 43 local employees into a digital workforce with virtual teams of over 150 global freelancers. Based on that experience we’ve built Flash Hub as a platform to scale systematically with virtual teams in the most flexible and reliable way.

One thing became very clear after all these trials and tribulations; 
Work can be different, work can be free and without limits, and work can be done by people who like their job, who can be independent and self-determined, and work can be done by people who see their job as something positive in their lives.

What we recently introduced in our offer that can help you transform and grow is 
- The Flash Hub Academy: a starter pack with 15 videos on how to build your own highly efficient remote team of global freelancers; 
- The Virtual Team Challenge: two-week group coaching featuring Manuel Pistner himself, where you will learn to build your own digital leadership system; and finally, 
- Personal support, where together with you, we analyze your individual business goals and create the blueprint of your virtual teams that can scale reliably with global freelancers. 

Grow your business beyond local borders.
